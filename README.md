# TreeSpace.js
A JavaScript implementation of the Walker node positioning algorithm. 

See inline documentation for usage.

Generally, TreeSpace accepts properly formatted JSON representing a hierarchical relationship as a node-based tree. In return, TreeSpace provides y-coordinates for an aesthetically pleasing visual layout. It is an implementation of JQ Walker's algorithm as described in his 1989 paper: http://www.cs.unc.edu/techreports/89-034.pdf.
